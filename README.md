# Prompt-Database-Template
This code sets up a PostgreSQL database (prompts_db) with tables to store prompt texts and associated results (text, image, code). The Python script establishes a connection to the database and provides functions to add prompts and their results. It enables easy storage and organization of diverse prompt-based content.
